### Conclusion:
Learn a lot from this project like the most important data-driven tests and regression testings  and also about the dashboard which will help us in the future by giving a quick overview of the results of the tests performed. Upon testing the website we found some bugs in the site related to login and signup of the user also there is no option available for cash on delivery which is their drawback back we sent a message to the website owner to please look into the bugs and make it better for usability.
